# Data Structures & Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms I've implemented myself in Python and Java for coding interview preparation


## Arraylists/Lists/Dynamic Arrays
* O(1) access by index, O(n) by searching (if unsorted)

## Hashtables/Hashmaps/Hashsets/Dictionaries
* maps keys to values (stored in linkedlists or arraylists to avoid collisions, known as **chaining**) with O(1) lookup
* put (key, value) into hash table and get(key) value

## Linked Lists
* non contigous sequence of nodes that hold data and point to the next node (and previous node if working with a doubly linked list)
* O(n) access to the nth element, but O(1) inserting/removing elements from the beginning of the list
